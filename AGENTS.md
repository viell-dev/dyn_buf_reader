## Lint Configuration

The crate uses strict lints configured in `Cargo.toml`. Key points:

- `unsafe_code = "deny"`, unsafe is forbidden except with `#[expect(unsafe_code, reason = "...")]`
- `clippy::allow_attributes_without_reason = "warn"`, always use `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]`
  instead of `#[allow(lint)]`
- Arithmetic, indexing, unwrap, and expect are all warned, use checked/saturating operations and
  document safety with `#[expect(..., reason = "...")]`

## Architecture

Single-crate library with four modules:

- **`buffer`**, `Buffer` struct: the standalone growable buffer with power-of-two-chunk capacity
  management. This is the core data structure.
- **`read`**, `DynBufRead` trait: extends `BufRead` with buffer inspection and memory management.
- **`reader`**, `DynBufReader<R>` + `DynBufReaderBuilder<R>`: wraps any `Read` with a `Buffer`,
  implements `Read`, `BufRead`, `DynBufRead`, and `Seek`. Treat this module as a work in
  progress rather than a style/reference target.
- **`constants`**, `CHUNK_SIZE` (8 KiB), `DEFAULT_MAX_CAPACITY` (256 MiB), and the internal
  `MAX_SUPPORTED_CAPACITY` / `MAX_EXPONENTIAL_CAPACITY`. All buffer capacities are multiples of
  `CHUNK_SIZE`; the internal max constants are technical ceilings, not public tuning knobs.

Key design: `Buffer` does the heavy lifting; `DynBufReader` delegates to it while enforcing
`max_capacity` and providing the trait impls. Tests live in sibling `tests.rs` files per module.
