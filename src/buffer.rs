/// varying data sizes. This type is also used as the internal buffer for

/// # Capacity Management
///
/// The buffer uses a chunk-based growth and shrinking strategy:
/// - **Growth**: Expands in exponential steps (powers of 2) aligned to [`CHUNK_SIZE`] boundaries,
///   allowing efficient memory allocation for large reads.
/// - **Shrinking**: Contracts linearly to `CHUNK_SIZE` multiples, freeing unused memory while

/// - **Alignment**: All capacities are multiples of `CHUNK_SIZE`, which is tuned for common
///   system page sizes.

///
/// - Large file processing with dynamic memory needs
/// - Stream buffering with arbitrary peek-ahead requirements
/// - Any scenario requiring efficient buffered reads with automatic capacity adjustment
///
