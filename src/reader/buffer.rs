//! ```
//! use dyn_buf_reader::buffer::Buffer;
//! use std::io::Cursor;
//!
//! let mut buffer = Buffer::new();
//! let mut reader = Cursor::new("aaaa:bbbb");
//!
//! // Read until delimiter
//! let count = buffer.fill_until(&mut reader, ':').unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(count, 5); // "aaaa:" (includes delimiter)
//!
//! // Access the data
//! assert_eq!(buffer.as_str().unwrap(), "aaaa:bbbb");
//!
//! // Consume what we processed
//! buffer.consume(count);

/// A dynamically sized buffer with chunked capacity management.
///
/// `Buffer` provides high-performance buffered I/O operations with automatic capacity adjustment.
/// It grows and shrinks its capacity based on usage patterns, making it ideal for scenarios with
/// varying data sizes. This type is also used as the internal buffer for
/// [`DynBufReader`](crate::DynBufReader).
///
/// # Capacity Management
///
/// The buffer uses a chunk-based growth and shrinking strategy:
/// - **Growth**: Expands in exponential steps (powers of 2) aligned to [`CHUNK_SIZE`] boundaries,
///   allowing efficient memory allocation for large reads.
/// - **Shrinking**: Contracts linearly to `CHUNK_SIZE` multiples, freeing unused memory while
///   maintaining alignment with typical page sizes for optimal I/O performance.
/// - **Alignment**: All capacities are multiples of `CHUNK_SIZE`, which is tuned for common
///   system page sizes.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Tokenization and parsing (e.g., JSON decoding with [`fill_while`](Self::fill_while) and
///   [`fill_until`](Self::fill_until))
/// - Large file processing with dynamic memory needs
/// - Stream buffering with arbitrary peek-ahead requirements
/// - Any scenario requiring efficient buffered reads with automatic capacity adjustment
///
/// # Invariants
///
/// This buffer maintains the invariant `0 <= self.pos <= self.len <= self.buf.len() <= self.cap <=
/// self.buf.capacity()` at all times, ensuring memory safety and correctness of all operations.
